<h1>QTLtree Home page</h1>

<p>Download the software <a href="QTLtree.tar.gz">here</a>.  This file contains example files and scripts to 
generate simulated data for use with QTLtree.</p>



<pre>
wget  http://math.nist.gov/tnt/tnt_126.zip
unzip -d tnt tnt_126.zip   # unzips into directory tnt
</pre>
<p>The software program QTLtree is available to download.  
Note that this program is still in testing and that the usual caveats apply.  
The program is not particularly user 
friendly and a limited manual for QTLtree is in the file
<a href="QTLtreeManual.pdf">QTLtreeManual.pdf</a> </p>

<h5>Unix Systems</h5>
<p>Software is C++ source code in the form of zipped tar files.  Download source (below).
Use<br>
<samp>gunzip -zxf QTLtree.tar.gz</samp>, change to the program directory <samp>QTLtree/src</samp> and type 
<samp>make</samp>
to compile the program. 

<h5>dependencies</h5>
<p>Note that the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">Gnu Scientific Library (gsl)</a> is required for the 
compilation of <b>QTLtree</b>.  This is available <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/">here</a> and 
binaries are available for the major linux distributions and cygwin/mingw32.</p>

<h6>TNT</h6>

<p>This software needs the <a href = "http://math.nist.gov/tnt">Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT)</a>
 for C++ to compile.  <a href = "http://math.nist.gov/tnt/tnt_126.zip">download</a> this library and unzip 
 into the src directory.  This library is a collection of headers and requires no further installation.  
 Commands to do this are included below, if you have <kbd>wget</kbd>.
</p>

<p>This program was designed to work with data that is in the same format as 
the <a href="http://www.gaworkshop.org/gaw17/data.html">GAW 17 data</a>.  
Requests can be made <a href="http://www.gaworkshop.org/gaw17/data.html">here</a>. It will work with these data directly.  
</p>

<p>My program <a href="http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/i.j.wilson/sima/index.html">sima</a>, can be used to simulate data to 
work with QTLtree.  A 
python file, is included in the distribution which can be used to execute this program
and generate data in the correct format.</p>

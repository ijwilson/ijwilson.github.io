Personal Web Page.  This is a github for my personal web page so that it can 
be hosted on github and also for the university web site.

It is a slight improvement to the university one but needs lots more work.  And to make sure that the 
links are not broken.

I should make a copy of this on my university home page when it is finished
Or at least link to it

A course to use Jekll on github pages is
